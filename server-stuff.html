<h1>Using PuTTY to administrate TC.</h1>

<h2>Controlling servers</h2>
For your convenience, there are a few scripts to start servers and do other operations.<br>
But first, let's make sure you're in the correct directory. Use the following command:<br>
<i>cd /home/minecraft</i><br>
Now you're ready to control the servers.<br>
<h3>Starting servers</h3>
To start a particular server, use the start scripts:<br>
<i>./start<b>Server</b>.sh</i><br>
This will start the server called <i><b>Server</i></b>. Replace <i><b>Server</i></b> with the name of the server you wish to start.<br>
<h3>Entering the console of servers</h3>
To enter the console of a particular server, use the see scripts:<br>
<i>./see<b>Server</b>.sh</i><br>
This will enter the console of the server called <i><b>Server</i></b>. Replace <i><b>Server</i></b> with the name of the server you wish to enter the console of.<br>
To exit the console and go back to the shell, use <b>Ctrl+A+D</b>.<br>
To stop a server, simply type the <i>stop</i> command while you are in the console of one of the servers. You will be returned to the shell once the server fully stops.<br>
To list the servers currently running, do <i>screen -ls</i> in the shell.<br>
<h2>Some useful linux commands</h2>
<b>ls</b> - List the files and folders where you are.
<b>ls [path]</b> - List the files and folders at [path].
<b>nano [file]</b> - Use nano to edit [file].
<b>cd [new directory]</b> - Change directories ("move yourself")
<b>cd ..</b> - move to the directory above this one (represented by .. in the shell.)
<b>cp [files...] [destination]</b> - Copy the files indicated by the list of space-separated paths to the destination path.
<b>mv [files...] [destination]</b> - Move the files indicated by the list of space-separated paths to the destination path. Also can be used as a rename function.
